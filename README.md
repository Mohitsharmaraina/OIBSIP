Web Development and Designing Intern at Oasis Infobyte
In this GitHub repository, I've compiled the projects developed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. These creations reflect my journey, from building foundation web elements like calculators using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Moving onward, my repertoire encompasses a tribute page and a practical to-do web app, showcasing a balance between aesthetics and usability. Venturing more profoundly, I tackled login authentication with Flask and delved into the full-stack territory.
