Web Development and Designing Intern at Oasis Infobyte:

In this GitHub repository, I've compiled the projects developed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. These creations reflect my journey, from building foundation web elements like calculators using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Moving onward, my repertoire encompasses a tribute page and a practical to-do web app, showcasing a balance between aesthetics and usability. Venturing more profoundly, I tackled login authentication with Flask and delved into the full-stack territory.
Structure of the Repository:

1. Task One: Calculator:
I built an interactive calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project required implementing basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interface included a display screen for input and results.

2. Task Two: Tribute Page:
I crafted a tribute page dedicated to Virat Kohli. The page highlighted his accomplishments and impact, using proper formatting, images, and fonts to enhance readability and visual appeal. This project allowed me to practice effective content presentation and styling techniques.

3. Task Three: A Basic To-Do Web App:
Using HTML, CSS, and  JavaScript, I developed a simple to-do web application. This app enabled users to add, edit, and mark tasks as completed. The interface featured separate lists for pending and completed tasks, fostering efficient task management. 

4. Task Four: Login Authentication:
I created a login authentication system using Flask, a Python web framework. Users could register, log in, and access a secure page. This project involved implementing user authentication, session management, and secure routing, showcasing my ability to develop user-centric web applications with backend functionality.

Running the Programs:
The programs have been tested on the Visual Studio Code IDE in Windows 11.
